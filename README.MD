# README

## Overview
This project contains a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the Google Chrome's Dino game. The agent uses Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and a custom Pygame-based environment to learn how to jump over cacti and avoid obstacles in the game.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.
3. Install the required packages using pip: `pip install pygame tensorflow stable-baselines3 numpy pyperclip`
4. Run the `train_dino.py` script to train the DQN agent.

## Showcase
[TODO: insert video of the trained agent playing the game here]
